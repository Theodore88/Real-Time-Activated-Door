# Time-Activated-Door
## Project Description
This repository contains the code and video demonstration of a time-activated chicken coup door. The purpose of this project was to automate the operation of a chicken coup door and allow for the door to open and close at the same time on a day-to-day basis. Future improvements include the implementation of an LCD to give a countdown until the next operation of the door and a button to allow for manual operation of the door.
