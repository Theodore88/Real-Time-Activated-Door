## Project Description
This repository contains the code and video demonstration of a time-activated chicken coup door. The purpose of this project was to automate the operation of a chicken coup door and allow for the door to open and close at the same time on a day-to-day basis. A doorbell button was also used as a button to retract and extend the linear actuator manually.
## Components Used 
- Arduino Uno
- DS3231 Real Time Clock Module
- L298N Motor Driver
- Linear Actuator
- Jumper Wires
- 12V Power Source
